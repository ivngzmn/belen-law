My case was very intense and difficult and, for more that I hesitated to seek legal counsel on the matter; when I met my Attorney, Belen T. Gomez, her level of self-confidence and professional expertise made me feel like I was talking to a friend, not an attorney. I shared my difficult life situation and, she guided me through the process in a comprehensive and kind manner. I am very grateful for her dedication in my case and for all her assistance during my life's most difficult times. Thanks to her and her legal staff for being of great help! I really appreciate it!`,
